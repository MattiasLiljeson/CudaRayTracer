# Ray tracing with CUDA

Simple parallell gpgpu raytracer written in CUDA.
The implementation is naive,
1 pixel = 1 cuda kernel.
If you are looking for something that is actually good,
look at Nvidia CUDA Optix or similar ;-).
Uses DirectX11 for visualization.

## Building
Sorry, no cmake :-/ (yet!).
Uses the windows SDK for DirectX11 so no cross-platform anyways :P.
Get yourself a fresh copy of visual studio and rock away with the .sln file!
